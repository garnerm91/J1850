03-07 GM Truck Instrument cluster 
---telemetry---
"A8 83 10 12 XX" can control the Fuel level, with XX being the variable. comes from pcm (00-FF range)
"C8 3B 10 10 xx" Controls the transmission temp comes from pcm 
"68 49 10 10 xx" controls the coolant temp comes from pcm
"A8 4B 10 11 XX" controls the Oil pressure (range seems to be 00-80 on gas cluster. I would assume diesel clusters use the full range 00-FF?)
"88 73 40 08 xx yy" controls voltage. XX is major and yy is minor. comes from BCM.

"E8 FF 10 03" will keep the memory alive? I'm not entirely sure here, but it keeps telemetry from resetting. This came from PCM. Only works for PCM messages.
"E8 FF 40 03" Same as above except BCM source

--Lights/DIC message--
"8A EA 10 A0 8C 00" Turns on cruise control light
"8A EA 58 20 94 00" Turns off the Airbag light.
Note: it doesn't seem to really care if the source is correct; in other words, the airbag light can be set by the PCM (source 10) if you wanted. Data byte 1 is the On/off with A0 being on and 20 being off. Data 2 is what light, and data 3 doesn't seem to matter.
Following the above info known lighs are:
84 Check Oil
85 engine overheat
8C Cruise Control
8E battery
90 seat belt
91 High beam
94 Airbag
95 ABS
9B No traction control
9C Low Coolant
9E carLock? IDK what that icon means
A6 Park brake (maybe?)
