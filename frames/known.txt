03-07 Instrument cluster 
"A8 83 10 12 XX" can control the Fuel level, with XX being the variable. comes from pcm (00-FF range)
"C8 3B 10 10 xx" Controls the transmission temp comes from pcm 
"68 49 10 10 xx" controls the coolant temp comes from pcm
"A8 4B 10 11 XX" controls the Oil pressure (range seems to be 00-80 on gas cluster. I would assume diesel clusters use the full range 00-FF?)
"88 73 40 08 xx yy" controls voltage. XX is major and yy is minor. comes from BCM.


"E8 FF 10 03" will keep the memory alive? I'm not entirely sure here, but it keeps telemetry from resetting. This came from PCM. Only works for PCM messages.
WANTED BCM equivalent of the above frame. I don't have a BCM, so I won't be able to find this myself.

Not controlled via class 2: Speed (pin a4 pulsed), Tach (pin a5 pulsed), Check engine (pin A1 Short low on)
