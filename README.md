# J1850VPW Module
J1850 Arduino module.

# Gerber Files
To make this module yourself download the .zip file. It contains all the gerber files needed. you can then upload this with your PCB fab house. I recommend JLC PCB.

# Building The Module
To build this module you will need to be able to solder with hotair (due to the xtal) everthing else can actually be solder with just a soldering iron. Use the .html file for your oldering BOM. You can ignore the mounting holes in the BOM its just how Altuim output it and I didn't edit it.
