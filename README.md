To make this module yourself download the .zip file. It contains all the gerber files needed. you can then upload this with your PCB fab house. I recommend JLC PCB.

# Building The Module
To build this module you will need to be able to solder with hotair or hotplate (due to the xtal) everthing else can actually be solder with just a soldering iron. Use the .html file for your oldering BOM. You can ignore the mounting holes in the BOM its just how Altuim output it and I didn't edit it.
